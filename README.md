# Validating Agricultural Data (Python)

## Project Overview
This project, **"Validating Agricultural Data,"** is part of an ambitious initiative aimed at automating farming in Maji Ndogo, a region with diverse and challenging agricultural landscapes. The goal was to validate and analyze an agricultural dataset, focusing on ensuring data accuracy and reliability, which is critical for making informed decisions on crop planting locations based on factors such as rainfall, soil type, and climate conditions.

## Project Parts

### Part 1: Data Import and Initial Analysis
Before diving into the 'how' of farming, it's crucial to figure out the 'where' and 'what'. This part of the project focuses on laying the groundwork for automation by analyzing variables like soil fertility, climate conditions, and geographical data. The data, stored in an SQLite database, is imported into a Pandas DataFrame and cleaned to make it suitable for analysis. The challenge lies in transforming this messy data into a coherent dataset that provides meaningful insights into the best farming practices for Maji Ndogo.

### Part 2: Data Visualization and Validation
In this phase, we turn raw data into insightful visual stories. Using Seaborn, we create various plots to explore relationships between variables such as rainfall, pH levels, and temperature. Additionally, this part emphasizes the importance of data validation. By comparing our agricultural data with weather data from nearby stations, we ensure that our data accurately reflects the environmental conditions of Maji Ndogo. This validation step is critical in laying down a trustworthy foundation for the project.

### Part 3: Advanced Data Validation and Hypothesis Testing
After encountering a mismatch between our dataset and weather station data, this part delves into hypothesis testing to validate the accuracy of our data. We reassess our tolerance levels and use statistical methods, such as t-tests, to compare the means and variances of our datasets. The goal is to determine whether the data in our MD_agric_df dataset truly represents reality. By scientifically validating our data, we can confidently proceed with our automation strategies for Maji Ndogo.

## Skills Utilized
- **Pandas:** For data manipulation and analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** To explore the dataset and uncover meaningful insights.
- **Data Cleaning:** Cleaning and reshaping messy data to make it suitable for analysis.
- **Data Visualization:** Using Seaborn to create insightful visual representations of the data.
- **Data Validation:** Comparing our dataset with external sources to ensure accuracy.
- **Hypothesis Testing:** Applying statistical methods to validate data accuracy.
- **Building Data Pipelines:** Designing and implementing pipelines to manage data flow.

## Dataset and Analysis
The dataset is stored in an SQLite database, split into multiple tables, each containing different variables such as soil fertility, climate conditions, and geographical data. The data was imported into Python, where it was cleaned, validated, and analyzed to uncover patterns and correlations that are crucial for determining the best farming practices in Maji Ndogo.

### Key Steps:
1. **Data Import:** Import the dataset from the SQLite database into a Pandas DataFrame, consolidating the information into a single table for analysis.
2. **Data Cleaning:** Address any inconsistencies or missing values in the dataset, ensuring that the data is ready for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Conduct exploratory analysis to identify trends, patterns, and correlations within the data.
4. **Data Visualization:** Use Seaborn to create plots that highlight key relationships in the data.
5. **Data Validation:** Compare the agricultural data with weather station data to validate its accuracy.
6. **Hypothesis Testing:** Perform statistical tests to confirm that the data accurately represents the environmental conditions in Maji Ndogo.
7. **Automation and Pipelines:** Implement automation to streamline the data processing and validation steps, ensuring that the analysis is efficient and reproducible.
